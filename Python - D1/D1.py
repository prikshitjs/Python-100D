# variables in python and how we show our stored data in variable

name = "Prikshit";

# in this line name is a variable name and "=" is a asignment operator you can store your
# string in single or double quote

# integer store in python
# now we store age in a variable in python name with "age"

age = 16;

# you cannot store a integer in duble or single quote if you store then python give you error

#and this is how you can store any datatype in variable like - strings, int, float, bool

store_string  = "your name"; #enter your name
store_int     = 97; #store the numbers
store_float   = 9.75;
store_boolean = bool(1) #store true or false

'''

now if you want to show your data to user then you use print function
print is a inbuild function of python thst used to show text on user screen
the syntax of print function is print(variable/"strint"/int/float/bool);

'''

print(name);
print(age);

# if you follow the above code then your output is-

'''
Prikshit
16
'''

# and this is how you can print some datatypes

print(store_string);
print(store_int);
print(store_float);
print(store_boolean);

# when you run this then your output is -

'''
your name - store_string
97        - store_int
9.75      - store_float
True      - store_boolean
